# Seoul Bike Data Analysis and Modeling

This repository contains Octave/MATLAB code for data analysis and predictive modeling on the **Seoul Bike Sharing Dataset**. The project implements various machine learning techniques including classification and regression, along with feature selection and evaluation through cross-validation.

---

## Project Overview

The code explores different approaches to predict bike rental counts based on weather and calendar data using:

- **Classification tasks** with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression (for classification), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and Logistic Regression.
- **Regression tasks** using Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression and KNN Regression.
- **Feature selection** through backward stepwise regression.
- **K-Fold cross-validation** for model performance evaluation.

## Dataset

The data used in this project is from the **Seoul Bike Sharing Demand** dataset, publicly available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

> Seoul Bike Sharing Demand [Dataset]. (2020). UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
> https://doi.org/10.24432/C5F62R

This dataset contains hourly and daily rental bike counts along with weather and calendar information collected in Seoul, South Korea.
